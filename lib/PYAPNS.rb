module PYAPNS

  ## PYAPNS::Client
  ## There's python in my ruby!
  ##
  ## This is a class used to send notifications, provision applications and
  ## retrieve feedback using the Apple Push Notification Service.
  ##
  ## PYAPNS is a multi-application APS provider, meaning it is possible to send
  ## notifications to any number of different applications from the same application
  ## and same server. It is also possible to scale the client to any number
  ## of processes and servers, simply balanced behind a simple web proxy.
  ## 
  ## It may seem like overkill for such a bare interface - after all, the 
  ## APS service is rather simplistic. However, PYAPNS takes no shortcuts when it
  ## comes to compleatness/compliance with the APNS protocol and allows the
  ## user many optimization and scaling vectors not possible with other libraries.
  ## No bandwidth is wasted, connections are persistent and the server is
  ## asynchronous therefore notifications are delivered immediately.
  ##
  ## PYAPNS takes after the design of 3rd party push notification service that
  ## charge a fee each time you push a notification, and charge extra for so-called
  ## 'premium' service which supposedly gives you quicker access to the APS servers.
  ## However, PYAPNS is free, as in beer and offers more scaling oportunites without
  ## the financial draw.
  ##
  ## Provisioning
  ##
  ## To add your app to the PYAPNS server, it must be `provisioned` at least once.
  ## Normally this is done once upon the start-up of your application, be it a web
  ## service, desktop application or whatever... It must be done at least once
  ## to the server you're connecting to. Multiple instances of PYAPNS will have
  ## to have their applications provisioned individually. To provision an application
  ## manually use the PYAPNS::Client#provision method.
  ## 
  ##    require 'pyapns'
  ##    client = PYAPNS::Client.configure
  ##    client.provision :app_id => 'cf', :cert => '/home/ss/cert.pem', :env => 'sandbox', :timeout => 15
  ##
  ## This basically says "add an app reference named 'cf' to the server and start
  ## a connection using the certification, and if it can't within 15 seconds, 
  ## raise a PYAPNS::TimeoutException
  ##
  ## That's all it takes to get started. Of course, this can be done automatically
  ## by using PYAPNS::ClientConfiguration middleware. PYAPNS::Client is a singleton
  ## class that is configured using the class method PYAPNS::Client#configure. It
  ## is sensibly configured by default, but can be customized by specifying a hash
  ## See the docs on PYAPNS::ClientConfiguration for a list of available configuration
  ## parameters (some of these are important, and you can specify initial applications)
  ## to be configured by default.
  ##
  ## Sending Notifications
  ## 
  ## Once your client is configured, and application provisioned (again, these
  ## should be taken care of before you write notification code) you can begin
  ## sending notifications to users. If you're wondering how to acquire a notification
  ## token, you've come to the wrong place... I recommend using google. However,
  ## if you want to send hundreds of millions of notifications to users, here's how
  ## it's done, one at a time...
  ##
  ## The PYAPNS::Client#notify is a sort of polymorphic method which can notify
  ## any number of devices at a time. It's basic form is as follows:
  ##
  ##     client.notify 'cf', 'long ass app token', {:aps=> {:alert => 'hello?'}}
  ##
  ## However, as stated before, it is sort of polymorphic:
  ##
  ##     client.notify 'cf', ['token', 'token2', 'token3'], [alert, alert2, alert3]
  ##
  ##     client.notify :app_id => 'cf', :tokens => 'mah token', :notifications => alertHash
  ##
  ##     client.notify 'cf', 'token', PYAPNS::Notification('hello tits!')
  ##
  ## As you can see, the method accepts paralell arrays of tokens and notifications
  ## meaning any number of notifications can be sent at once. Hashes will be automatically
  ## converted to PYAPNS::Notification objects so they can be optimized for the wire
  ## (nil values removed, etc...), and you can pass PYAPNS::Notification objects
  ## directly if you wish.
  ##
  ## Retrieving Feedback
  ##
  ## The APS service offers a feedback functionality that allows application servers
  ## to retrieve a list of device tokens it deems to be no longer in use, and the
  ## time it thinks they stopped being useful (the user uninstalled your app, better
  ## luck next time...) Sounds pretty straight forward, and it is. Apple recommends
  ## you do this at least once an hour. PYAPNS will return an Array of 2-element 
  ## Arrays with the date and the token:
  ##
  ##      feedbacks = client.feedback 'cf'
  ##      => [[#<XMLRPC::DateTime:0x123 ... >, 'token'], 
  ##          [#<XMLRPC::DateTime:0x456 ... >, 'token'], ... ]
  ##
  ## Note that the date is an instance of XMLRPC::DateTime, which you'll probably 
  ## want to call #to_time on to get back a regular Time instance. And, if you're
  ## searching for or comparing the token received in the hexadecimal form returned, 
  ## note that it's lowercase hex.
  ##
  ## Asynchronous Calls
  ##
  ## PYAPNS::Client will, by default, perform no funny stuff and operate entirely
  ## within the calling thread. This means that certain applications may hang when,
  ## say, sending a notification, if only for a fraction of a second. Obviously 
  ## not a desirable trait, all `provision`, `feedback` and `notify`
  ## methods also take a block, which indicates to the method you want to call
  ## PYAPNS asynchronously, and it will be done so handily in another thread, calling
  ## back your block with a single argument when finished. Note that `notify` and `provision`
  ## return absolutely nothing (nil, for you rub--wait you are ruby developers!).
  ## It is probably wise to always use this form of operation so your calling thread
  ## is never blocked (especially important in UI-driven apps and asynchronous servers)
  ## Just pass a block to provision/notify/feedback like so:
  ##
  ##     PYAPNS::Client.instance.feedback do |feedbacks|
  ##        feedbacks.each { |f| trim_token f }
  ##     end

  ## PYAPNS::ClientConfiguration
  ## A middleware class to make PYAPNS::Client easy to use in web contexts
  ##
  ## Automates configuration of the client in Rack environments
  ## using a simple confiuration middleware. To use PYAPNS::Client in
  ## Rack environments with the least code possible use PYAPNS::ClientConfiguration
  ## (no, really, in some cases, that's all you need!) middleware with an optional
  ## hash specifying the client variables. Options are as follows:
  ##
  ##   use PYAPNS::ClientConfiguration(
  ##        :host => 'http://localhost/' 
  ##        :port => 7077,
  ##        :initial => [{

  ##            :env => 'sandbox',
  ##            :timeout => 15
  ##   }])
  ##
  ## Where the configuration variables are defined:
  ##
  ##    :host     String      the host where the server can be found
  ##    :port     Number      the port to which the client should connect
  ##    :initial  Array       OPTIONAL - an array of INITIAL hashes
  ##
  ##    INITIAL HASHES:
  ##
  ##    :app_id   String      the id used to send messages with this certification
  ##                          can be a totally arbitrary value
  ##    :cert     String      a path to the certification or the certification file
  ##                          as a string
  ##    :env      String      the environment to connect to apple with, always
  ##                          either 'sandbox' or 'production'
  ##    :timoeut  Number      The timeout for the server to use when connecting
  ##                          to the apple servers

  ##    note = PYAPNS::Notification.new 'alert text', 9, 'flynn.caf', {:extra => 'guid'}
  ##
  ##    -- or --
  ##    note = PYAPNS::Notification.new 'alert text'
